# GoldCardPublic
A public repository for the defunct GoldCard discord bot!

The code base was made ~5 years ago when I was learning Java in high school.
I then was teaching myself Python later and decided to recode this in Python
This was way before I knew Python syntax or formatting, so this project is messy! 
be warned!

Additionally, this is outdated (around when Ka'sante was released)
so icons, items, and such will need to be redone
If you want a database or help, I'd recommend the [Third Party Developer Community](https://discord.gg/riotgamesdevrel) Discord server.
